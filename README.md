# Sudoku
## Console game app with three levels of difficulty
### *Rules:*
Sudoku is played on a grid of 9x9 spaces. Each row, column and square (3x3 grid) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.

### *About the game:*
When you start the game you have to choose the level (1-easy, 2-medium, 3-hard). Then you will see the sudoku. In each step you have to enter 3 numbers: first for a row, second for a column/position and the third is the number you want to set. For rows and columns enter a number between 0-8 (this means that the first row/column is 0). Numbers are between 1-9. 
If you make Ð° mistake and enter a number in a wrong position, you can delete it when you enter 0 (zero) for the number in the next step (row, position, 0). And remember you can only delete the number that you entered, not the original numbers. The game ends when you solve the sudoku.
